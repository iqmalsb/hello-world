# hello-world
My first repository

My name is Iqmal Shamsul Bahari, and I am a Bachelor in Computer Science student from Management & Science University (MSU), Malaysia.
I'm fairly excited to be able to learn how to use GitHub to develop my knowledge and improve coding skills.
Currently, at the time of writing this, I am familiar with C++, Java, and PHP language.
I also like to play video games during my free time :)
